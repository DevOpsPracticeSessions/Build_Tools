Objective : This is a small excerise we are going to build the Java project and using Maven as a build tool to automate it 
and deploy it in the server.  

Java is a open source and we can download the required libraries from the internet and start working on it. The advantage of Java 
is once we done our development and compile the source code and implement it on any platform.So it is a platform independent 
and no need to install any softwares in client side.

Install the Java JDK and JRE in your machine before you start of your development. Please refer the below link.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/install/installation-jdk-and-jre-microsoft-windows-platforms.htm#JSJIG-GUID-A7E27B90-A28D-4237-9383-A58B416071CA

Once you install the JDK and JRE and it needs to be added in your environment vairable path. Follow the procedure given in the above link.

For Development purpose , we require JDK otherwise JRE (Java Runtime environment) is enough to run the project. ex: WAR file

Save the below file as TestProgram.Java. We can use any text editor and save the file as .java extenstion. 

class TestProgram{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
     System.out.println("Devops program started");  
    }  
}  

Note: Make sure you are in folder where you have saved your Java program and start compiling.

To compile:	javac TestProgram.java   ( In the command prompt , just use this command and press enter and it will check our program if the code 
contains any error. After that run the below command to execut the program.

To execute:	java TestProgram

Output:Devops program started
